<h2>Hey guys,</h2>

<p class="text1">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - </p>
<p class="text2">another important game guideline.</p>
</div>

<section class="section-1">

    <h3>Youtubability</h3>
    
    <p>  
       A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity
       of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.

       Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the
       full potential of your game by working on
       getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your
       games.

       Many elements can be used to make your
       game clearer :

       For instance, ask yourself if a user’s interaction
       with the game is <strong>evident,</strong> for
       example, can she tell which character she
       <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong> Does it
       look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the
       game after 1 second (great!) or after 10
       seconds (too long!).
       </p>
    <p>

       Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate
       the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix
       Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> (in
       orange here) and instantly recognized as
       a threat.

    <p class="section2-p1">
    If you want to run user tests with 
    friends and family or even random
    people in the street, it is interesting to 
    show them the 30 second video before
    making them try to prototype in order 
    to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from 
    the video vs. the actual game they try.
    </p>

    <p class="section2-p2">
    <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements 
    that help <strong>understand the objective and
    controls</strong> of the game, like with the
    target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s  
    Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw 
    Car with the space dedicated to 
    drawing.

    People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their 
    phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when 
    displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong>You should 
    also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if 
    someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 
    to 5 seconds, this is an accelerated elevator pitch!
  </p>
  <p class="section3-p2">
    Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on 
    YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea 
    for your game videos.
